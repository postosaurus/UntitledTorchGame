# UntitledTorchGame
2D platformer game based on lightmask and torches


Hallo everyone, I present to you the Untitled Torch.
It is still in development, to be honest I am in the early stages of creation, but still I wanted to share my progress and keep me motivated through the process by creating already something to look at and maybe you have some feedback or ideas for me.

I keep a devlog along with the repo, go and check it here:

For any feedback I will be very happy.
